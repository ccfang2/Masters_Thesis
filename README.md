# Masters_Thesis

This repository contains all codes that are needed to create my Masters Thesis **Dimension Adaptive Estimation** at Department of Economics, Universität Bonn, Germany. This thesis was completed with the supervision from Prof. Dr. Joachim Freyberger in September 2023.

You may find the paper in folder `Thesis/Masters_Thesis` or download the [pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccfang2/Masters_Thesis/main/Thesis/Masters_Thesis.pdf) directly. Simulation and application codes are also in respective folders. To implement our dimension adaptive estimation, you may find it helpful to use our R package [dimada](https://github.com/ccfang2/dimada).
