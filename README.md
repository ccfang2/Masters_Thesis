# Masters_Thesis
> This repository contains all data and codes that I need to create my Masters Thesis entitled "Dimension Adaptive Estimation". This thesis was completed with the supervision from Prof. Dr. Joachim Freyberger at Institute of Finance and Statistics, Universität Bonn in September 2023. After the completion of this thesis, I will start the dissertation phase of my PhD program at Bonn.

## R package
To implement our dimension adaptive estimation in your own studies, you may find it helpful to use our R package [dimada](https://github.com/ccfang2/dimada). Practical Suggestions of using our estimation method can be found in Section 7.4 of this thesis.
